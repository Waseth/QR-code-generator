# QR Code Generator

This is a simple web app that generates a **unique QR code** based on any text or URL you input.
When the QR code is scanned, it either **opens the link** you entered or **displays the text** directly.

## What I Learned, reminded myself or or understood
Building this project helped me understand and apply a bunch of core web dev concepts:

1. **DOM manipulation** — selecting and updating elements dynamically with JavaScript
2. **Asynchronous functions** — using event listeners and dynamic image loading
3. **API integration** — I used a QR generator API
4. **Error handling and validation** — preventing empty inputs
